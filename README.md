## Repository branches:

The hip-tests repository maintains several branches. The branches that are of importance are:

* Main branch: This is the stable branch. It is up to date with the latest release branch, for example, if the latest release is rocm-5.4, main branch will be the repository based on this release.
* Develop branch: This is the default branch, on which the new features are still under development and visible. While this maybe of interest to many, it should be noted that this branch and the features under development might not be stable.
* Release branches. These are branches corresponding to each ROCM release, listed with release tags, such as rocm-5.4, etc.

## Release tagging:

hip-tests releases are typically naming convention for each ROCM release to help differentiate them.

* rocm x.yy: These are the stable releases based on the ROCM release.
  This type of release is typically made once a month.*


### Build HIP catch tests

For building HIP from sources, please check instructions on [HIP page] (https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/blob/rocm-5.4.x/docs/markdown/hip_build.md#build-hip-on-amd-platform)

HIP catch tests can be built via the following instructions,

Clone the hip-tests from rocm-5.4.x branch
```
git clone -b rocm-5.4.x https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip-tests.git
export HIP_TESTS_DIR="$(readlink -f hip-tests)"
```

Build the catch tests
```
cd "$HIP_TESTS_DIR"
mkdir -p build; cd build
export HIP_PATH=/opt/rocm-5.4/ (or any custom path where HIP is installed)
cmake ../catch/  -DHIP_PLATFORM=amd
make -j$(nproc) build_tests
ctest # run tests
```

HIP catch tests are built under the folder $HIP_TESTS_DIR/build.

### Build HIP Catch2 standalone test

HIP Catch2 supports build a standalone test, for example,

```
hipcc $HIP_TESTS_DIR/catch/unit/memory/hipPointerGetAttributes.cc -I ./catch/include ./catch/hipTestMain/standalone_main.cc -I ./catch/external/Catch2 -o hipPointerGetAttributes
./hipPointerGetAttributes
```

### Building with address sanitizer

To build catch tests with Address Sanitizer options, use the cmake option `-DASAN_BUILD=ON`
