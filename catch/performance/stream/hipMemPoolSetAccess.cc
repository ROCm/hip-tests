 * Test Description
 * ------------------------
 *  - Executes `hipMemPoolSetAccess` with `hipMemAccessFlagsProtReadWrite`.
 * Test source
 * ------------------------
 *  - performance/stream/hipMemPoolSetAccess.cc
 * Test requirements
 * ------------------------
 *  - Device supports memory pools
 *  - HIP_VERSION >= 5.2
